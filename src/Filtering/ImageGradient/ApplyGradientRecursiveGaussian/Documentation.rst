Synopsis
--------

Computes the gradient of an image by convolution with the first derivative of a Gaussian.

The output of the GradientRecursiveGaussianImageFilter is composed of two imagescomponents (gradients along the X and Y directions). In this example, we store these components using an image with CovariantVector pixel type. Covariant vectors are the natural representation for gradients since they are the equivalent of normals to iso-values manifolds.

This example shows also how to extract the X and Y gradients as images, and how to compute the magnitude of the CovariantVector image.

Note that the covariant vector types were only added to the VectorIndexSelectionCastImageFilter Python wrapping in ITK 4.7.
